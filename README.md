This is the first ever source code of KROEN CMS as of March 2011, my  first attempt at developing an interactive web application. The original file was 2MB long, I had to trim it.  You should still be able to run this code with existing stuff. The Kroen CMS of 2011 is not comparable with the Kroen CMS of now.
